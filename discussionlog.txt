Assignment 2
Discussion Log: 

I began working on this assignment with Margaret Haley. However, after a short discussion about the logic to find the rank of the cards, I worked on my own to finish the assignment. I assumed I was almost done. However, I came across many obstacles. I have changed my code many times. I have discussed logic, and possible error checking with Margaret Haley and Michael. I mostly worked with Margaret and we tried to trace our code to figure out the common mistakes. Furthermore, I have taken help from the Professor during office hours when I wanted to clear the concepts. I have not talked or discussed specifics of my code with anyone and have not discussed anything with anyone other than people mentioned above. Finally, I learned many new concepts including stacks.
